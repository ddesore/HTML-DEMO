<p>These super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are the most popular cookie recipe. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. And you don’t even need a mixer!</p>
<p>There are thousands of chocolate chip cookies recipes out there. Everyone has their favorite and this one is mine. Just a glance at the <i>hundreds</i> of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too! In fact, if you asked me which recipe to keep in your apron pocket, my answer would be this one. (In addition to a classic cut-out <u>sugar cookies</u> and flaky <u>pie crust</u>, of course!) Just read the comments on a post in our Facebook group. These cookies are loved… and, warning: they disappear FAST
